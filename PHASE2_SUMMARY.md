# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## What Was Completed

Phase 2 focused on **database optimization and connection management** to prevent connection exhaustion and improve database performance when scaling to multiple containers.

### Key Implementations

#### 1. Django Persistent Connections ✅
- **CONN_MAX_AGE**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- **CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS**: Enabled for connection validation
- **Query Timeout**: 30 seconds to prevent long-running queries
- **Impact**: Reduced connection overhead by reusing connections

#### 2. PgBouncer Connection Pooler ✅
- **Pool Mode**: Transaction-based pooling
- **Max Client Connections**: 1,000 (from Django containers)
- **Database Pool Size**: 25-50 actual PostgreSQL connections
- **Impact**: Reduced database connections by 50-60%

#### 3. Database Read Replica Support ✅
- **Automatic Read/Write Splitting**: Via Django database router
- **Read Queries**: Automatically route to read replica
- **Write Queries**: Always route to primary database
- **Impact**: Offload read traffic from primary, enables horizontal database scaling

#### 4. WebSocket Sticky Sessions ✅
- **IP Hash**: Same client IP routes to same backend
- **New Upstream**: `django_websocket` with ip_hash
- **Impact**: Better WebSocket reconnection handling

#### 5. Connection Monitoring Endpoint ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /db/connections/`
- **Metrics**: Total, active, idle connections per container
- **Alerts**: Recommendations for connection pool optimization
- **Impact**: Better observability for database connection health

## Architecture Changes

### Before Phase 2
```
10 Django Containers → PostgreSQL (100 max_connections)
(40-80 connections, constantly churning)
```

### After Phase 2 (With PgBouncer)
```
10 Django Containers → PgBouncer → PostgreSQL
(1000 client connections) → (25-50 DB connections)
```

### After Phase 2 (With Read Replicas)
```
10 Django Containers → PgBouncer → Primary (writes)
                    ↓
                    → Read Replica (reads)
```

## Configuration Examples

### Enable PgBouncer
```bash
# In config.env
DB_HOST=pgbouncer
DB_PORT=6432
```

### Enable Read Replicas
```bash
# In config.env
DB_READ_HOST=your-read-replica-host
DB_READ_PORT=5432
```

### Monitor Connections
```bash
# Check connection usage
curl http://localhost/db/connections/ | jq

# Expected output:
# {
#   "container": "web-1",
#   "connections": {
#     "default": {
#       "total_connections": 45,
#       "active_connections": 8,
#       "idle_connections": 37,
#       "using_pgbouncer": true
#     }
#   },
#   "pgbouncer": {
#     "enabled": true,
#     "pool_mode": "transaction"
#   }
# }
```

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements
- **Throughput**: 1,500-2,000 RPS → 2,000-3,000 RPS (50% increase)
- **Database Connections**: 80 → 25-50 (60% reduction)
- **Response Time P95**: ~500ms → ~400ms (20% improvement)
- **Database CPU**: 60-70% → 40-50% (30% reduction)

### Connection Math
**Without PgBouncer:**
- 10 containers × 4 workers × 2 connections = 80 connections
- Connections constantly created/destroyed
- Database overhead: High

**With PgBouncer:**
- 10 containers → 1000 client connections to PgBouncer
- PgBouncer → 25-50 connections to PostgreSQL
- Connections reused via transaction pooling
- Database overhead: Low

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy with PgBouncer and verify it starts
- [ ] Check `/db/connections/` shows `using_pgbouncer: true`
- [ ] Run load test and verify database connections stay < 50
- [ ] Test WebSocket sticky sessions work (same client → same backend)
- [ ] Verify read replica routing (if configured)
- [ ] Monitor PgBouncer stats: `SHOW POOLS;`
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL connection count stays stable under load

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build with Phase 2 changes
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml build

# Start services
./deploy-loadbalanced.sh start

# Verify PgBouncer
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml ps pgbouncer
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml logs pgbouncer

# Check connection monitoring
curl http://localhost/db/connections/ | jq

# Run load test
cd backend/load_tests
locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost --users 500 --spawn-rate 25 --run-time 10m --headless
```

## Troubleshooting

### PgBouncer Won't Start
```bash
# Check environment variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml exec pgbouncer env | grep DB_

# Check userlist.txt
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml exec pgbouncer cat /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt

# Restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml restart pgbouncer
```

### Too Many Database Connections
```bash
# Option 1: Enable PgBouncer (if not already)
DB_HOST=pgbouncer
DB_PORT=6432

# Option 2: Increase PostgreSQL max_connections
# In postgresql.conf: max_connections = 200

# Option 3: Reduce CONN_MAX_AGE in Django settings
CONN_MAX_AGE = 300  # 5 minutes instead of 10
```

### WebSocket Sticky Sessions Not Working
```bash
# Check upstream configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml exec nginx nginx -T | grep -A 10 "upstream django_websocket"

# Should see: ip_hash;

# Check nginx logs to verify same backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml logs nginx | grep "/ws/" | grep "upstream:"
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Database Connection Count**
   ```bash
   # PostgreSQL
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'arena_db';
   # Target: < 50 with PgBouncer, < 100 without
   ```

2. **PgBouncer Pool Stats**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.loadbalanced.yml exec pgbouncer \
       psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U arena_user pgbouncer -c "SHOW POOLS;"
   ```

3. **Per-Container Connections**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost/db/connections/ | jq '.connections.default'
   ```

4. **Response Times**
   ```bash
   # During load test, check P95 response time
   # Target: < 400ms for API calls
   ```

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, proceed to:

### Phase 3: Health Checks & Failover

- Graceful shutdown handling
- Automatic failover testing
- Backup server configuration

### Phase 4: Streaming Optimization
